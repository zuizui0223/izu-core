# Campanula Channel Identification

A field-design, causal-identification, and constrained-simulation repository for asking a deliberately narrow question about island floral-trait variation:

\[
W(z)=F(z)E(z).
\]

For a predeclared trait \(z\), can a difference between island regimes be assigned to

- **local reproduction** \(F(z)\), or
- **establishment / reachability conditional on viable seed output** \(E(z)\),

rather than merely described as a difference in flower size, selfing, or visitor identity?

## Current empirical state

The repository is currently a **focal Campanula calibration plus a prediction-locked comparative programme**, not a completed cross-lineage meta-analysis.

- floral size and multilocus outcrossing are retained as continuous erosion across the focal island series;
- autonomous reproductive capacity shows the source-locked Oshima-to-no-Bombus second-transition step;
- 300-DPI flattened-corolla scans now support a measured focal guide decline from Oshima to the no-Bombus islands;
- no independent specialist lineage is yet eligible for the positive holdout;
- one open-generalist lineage supplies a usable three-regime negative control;
- no public-photo ROI proposal is eligible for broad specialist release; and
- `environment_only` remains unranked until climate, area, isolation, and history enter an explicit comparison likelihood.

The current counts, claim boundaries, and next admissible actions are generated from committed tables:

```bash
python scripts/report_current_evidence_state.py \
  --markdown-out artifacts/current_evidence_state.md \
  --json-out artifacts/current_evidence_state.json
```

See [`docs/CURRENT_EVIDENCE_STATE.md`](docs/CURRENT_EVIDENCE_STATE.md). When an older pilot or simulation document conflicts with that generated state, the generated state and its machine-readable source tables take precedence.

## What this repository does

- records the minimum theorem-compatible measurement design for the factorisation above;
- distinguishes direct measurements from proxies whose calibration must be stable or independently checked;
- keeps published patterns, prospective field measurements, and pollinator-specific claims separate;
- generates a current evidence/readiness report so discovery counts and failed operators cannot be mistaken for empirical replication;
- provides a lightweight readiness checker for a proposed sampling design;
- provides a constrained life-history simulation layer for comparing explicitly declared mechanisms against predeclared observation intervals;
- ranks proposed future measurements by how strongly they distinguish the parameter candidates still compatible with current observations;
- provides a nectar-guide mechanism model that separates guide effects on visitation, legitimate handling/pollen placement, and guide-expression cost;
- extends that model, in explicit layers, to paternal success, pollinator guilds, late inbreeding depression, temporal variation, genetic-versus-plastic expression, and spatial recruitment;
- turns those layers into restricted competing scenarios and tests whether a planned observation set can recover a known virtual mechanism;
- simulates whether candidate measurement plans, their effective sample sizes, and their declared observation variation can actually discriminate those scenarios;
- maps fruit-level seed set plus partial paternity assignment into selfed and outcrossed seed observations without pretending every mature seed is genotyped.

The simulation layer does not estimate an unobserved cost from a trait alone. It retains the **set of parameter values compatible with all declared observations**, then makes the remaining uncertainty explicit. The measurement-ranking layer identifies which proposed observable would split that remaining set most strongly at a predeclared assay resolution. The guide-evolution layers specify which intermediate observation is needed before a proposed evolutionary mechanism can be used in a field-facing claim. The scenario-recovery layer asks whether those observations actually discriminate competing mechanisms before field data are collected. The design-power layer asks how that discrimination changes as effective sample size and total measurement variation change. See [the simulation specification](docs/constrained_life_history_simulation.md), [the measurement-ranking specification](docs/discriminating_measurements.md), [the nectar-guide mechanism model](docs/nectar_guide_mechanism_model.md), [the full six-layer guide-evolution model](docs/guide_evolution_model.md), [the scenario recovery workflow](docs/guide_scenario_recovery.md), [the design-power workflow](docs/guide_design_power.md), and [the seed-set/paternity sampling protocol](docs/seed_set_paternity_sampling.md).

## Guide-evolution layers

```text
1. maternal + paternal genetic contribution
2. guild-resolved visit, handling, deposition, and export
3. late inbreeding depression after seed set
4. temporal fitness and geometric mean performance
5. genetic guide baseline versus plastic expression
6. spatial dispersal, establishment, and capacity-limited recruitment
```

These layers are deliberately modular. Do not activate a layer merely because it exists: activate it only when its required intermediate quantity is measured or has a defensible calibration.

## Competing scenario workflow

```text
M0 null guide
M1 guide → visits
M2 guide → handling / pollen placement
M3 guide → paternal export and siring
M4 assurance compensation
M5 spatial establishment
M6 mixed
```

A coarse terminal outcome such as recruit number should generally leave several scenarios compatible. The model becomes useful when intermediate measurements—guild-resolved visits, contact/pollen deposition, cross type, paternity, or patch recruitment—reduce that compatible set.

## Design-power workflow

For a virtual truth and declared alternatives, a measurement plan now reports:

```text
truth retention rate
unique true-scenario recovery rate
mean compatible scenarios
false-scenario survival rate
```

The current error model uses the effective independent sample size and total individual-level SD on each measured scale. It is a planning approximation, not a replacement for a count, binomial, or hierarchical observation model when those are required by the data.

## What it does not claim

A visit count is not automatically a measurement of local reproduction. Likewise, flower-size means, selfing rates, and pollinator turnover alone do not identify \(F\) versus \(E\).

A successful simulated reconstruction is not proof that its mechanism generated the field pattern. It is only a compatibility result conditional on a declared life cycle, parameter ranges, and measurement intervals.

A high-ranked measurement is not automatically the best field protocol: its feasibility, sampling variance, biological relevance, and cost still require an explicit field-design check.

A positive nectar-guide relative-performance contrast is not itself evidence that guides evolved by that mechanism. It must be paired with heritable or otherwise genetically grounded guide variation, a measured intermediate pathway, and comparison against selfing compensation and E-stage explanations.

The factorisation is a declared model choice. It does not claim that all natural processes are multiplicative or independent.

## Repository boundary

This is the active empirical design home for the Campanula/Izu channel-identification program extracted from `microdonta`.

The model architecture can represent the major routes by which nectar-guide variation could affect long-term genetic contribution. It does **not** make those routes identifiable without data: every guide-evolution claim still requires a declared life cycle, a common census scale, measured intermediates, and a competing-model comparison.

## Relationship to RACH causal invariants

[`rach-causal-invariants`](https://github.com/zuizui0223/rach-causal-invariants) is the separate general-methods repository. It provides finite qualitative-program grammars, robust-admissibility classifications, coverage labels, and exact known-truth observation-channel calibration. It does not specify floral fitness, island geography, pollinator guilds, pollen deposition, recruitment, or any Campanula parameter.

This repository owns those biological assumptions: the \(F(z)E(z)\) factorisation, the nectar-guide life cycle, scenario parameters, observation units, and field protocol. A small predeclared subset of Campanula scenarios may be translated into a RACH candidate universe to audit the logical consequences of a qualitative observation design. That translation is an audit layer, not a code dependency and not empirical validation of a Campanula mechanism.
